# ionic2

## How to run

- Git clone the repository
- Run the following commands:
- ```npm i```
- (At this point, connect your mobile device to your computer)
- ``` ionic build```
- ```ionic cap copy```
- For android ```ionic cap run android -l --external``` or for iPhone ```ionic cap run ios -l --external```

## Notes

- I have an android phone, so I was only able to develop on an android device. I am not too sure how it would turn out on ios.
- Learning and using typescript, ionic and angular was pretty fun. Getting my head around everything took longer than I thought, but I am pretty happy with what I've done
